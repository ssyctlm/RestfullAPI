# A practice
I have a plan for this pracitce:

-**First**: A step by step practice to achieve a restful API program, to familiar with nodejs, ExpressJs, Mongodb, Mongoose and other micro server stuffs.

-**Second**: Convert this product/order program to a todo program

-**Third**: Make frontend user interface

-**Forth**: Pack this whole program with electron

## ExpressJs
## Mongoose
  - schema
  - model
  - querry
  - crud
